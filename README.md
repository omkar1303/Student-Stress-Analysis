# Student Stress Analysis

# Overview
Student Stress Analysis and Prediction is a data-driven project designed to analyze stress levels among students and predict potential stress outcomes using machine learning techniques. With increasing academic demands and lifestyle pressures, student mental health has become an important area of concern. This project aims to identify key factors contributing to stress and provide early predictions that can help institutions, educators, and students take proactive measures to improve well-being and academic performance.

# Project Structure
The project is organized in a modular manner to ensure clarity and maintainability. The dataset directory contains the student data used for stress analysis and prediction. 
The notebooks folder includes Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and initial model experimentation.

The src directory holds the core Python scripts responsible for data preprocessing, model training, and stress prediction. 
The results directory stores visualizations and evaluation metrics generated during analysis. 
Supporting files such as requirements.txt manage project dependencies, while README.md provides documentation. An optional app.py file is included for deploying the model as an application.

# Methodology
1.**Data Collection**
The dataset includes student-related attributes such as academic workload, sleep duration, study hours, mental health indicators, and lifestyle habits.

2.**Data Preprocessing**
Data cleaning techniques were applied to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical variables for consistent model performance.

3.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Statistical analysis and data visualization were used to understand stress patterns and identify relationships between different contributing factors.

4.**Model Training and Prediction**
Machine learning models were trained on the processed data to predict student stress levels. The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets to ensure unbiased evaluation.

5.**Model Evaluation**
Model performance was assessed using accuracy and other standard metrics to validate the reliability of predictions.

# Result
- The analysis revealed that academic pressure, poor sleep quality, and workload imbalance are major contributors to student stress.
- The predictive model achieved strong performance on test data, indicating reliable stress level predictions.
- Visualizations provided clear insights into stress trends across different student groups.
- The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can assist in early stress detection and support better mental health management among students.
